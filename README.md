## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- jQuery (Javascript Library)

### What I learned

- I have learned lots and lots about using jQuery, especially about reading from a JSON file using jQuery and also some great jQuery methods such as .each(), .siblings(), .parent() and more.

-My general proficiency with JavaScript(jQuery) syntax has improved.

### Continued development

-As much as I have learnt about jQuery, it is merely the tip of the iceberg as I intend to spend coming months in polishing up my skills with the afore-mentioned library.

### Useful resources
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - A lot of my questions were already asked the way I wanted to ask it and different experienced people had already given their views and methods.
